1. create empty dict of user ratings
u_ratings = {}

2. for rating in ratings by that specific user
for r in u.ratings:

3. put in dict with movie ID as key, rating as value
     u_ratings[r.movie_id] = r

paired_ratings = []

5. if you have a rating for that movie,
create a tuple pair of (my rating, other person's rating)
append to list

o = other_users[0]
other_users is a list of people who have rated the movie we're trying
to get a predction for

u.rating = everything I've rated
o. rating = everything that other user has rated

for o_rating in o.ratings:
     u_rating = u_ratings.get(o_rating.movie_id)
     if u_rating:
         pair = (u_rating.score, o_rating.score)
         paired_ratings.append(pair)
